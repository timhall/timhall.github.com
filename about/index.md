## Professional Experience

__Cornerstone Systems NW__, Working Remotely  May 2013 – Present

Software Developer

- Work collaboratively as part of a remote team of developers on a large Backbone.js application, iteratively developing an advanced system that condenses extensive information and tasks into a focused, simple interface
- Methodically update legacy code into maintainable components, including converting an existing native-to-client-side bridge from Python to Node.js
- Investigate and resolve bugs, often involving transient or low-level errors, introducing test cases to avoid future regressions and documenting or removing module couplings to reduce unforeseen interactions
- Implement performance improvements such as utilizing caching or incremental updates for slow-running queries and applying asynchronous events to handle blocking or poorly-performing components
- Create composable and configurable d3.chart system that dramatically simplifies the process of creating new chart types (Line, Bars, etc.) and allows rapid iteration of chart design and layout
- Craft an asynchronous data layer for working with csv data in d3, including querying, caching, filtering, reducing, formatting, and other advanced behavior

__Nexant – Demand Management__, Cary, NC  August 2011 – May 2013

Project Engineer 

- Coordinated with a distributed team to lead development of web-based energy auditing tools to modernize existing spreadsheet tools and introduce new offerings, using HTML5, CSS3, Knockout.js, and Node.js to quickly build dynamic web applications
- Developed advanced engineering tools and process automation using Excel VBA and leveraging REST APIs (including Salesforce, Trello, and others) to standardize and improve engineering calculations and processing for lighting, HVAC, insulation, and weather
See Excel-REST for details: https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST
- Implemented test-driven development framework for customer-facing and internal spreadsheets to reduce product maintenance, allow faster iteration of new features, and ensure accurate energy savings and rebates 
See Excel-TDD for details: https://github.com/timhall/Excel-TDD
University of Maryland – Advanced Manufacturing Lab, College Park, MD August 2009 – August 2011
Graduate Research Assistant, Lab Manager
- Collaborated with a multi-functional product development team on the design of advanced polymer heat exchangers including establishing and maintaining individual and overall project schedules that ensured continued progress, prioritizing project tasks and goals, and composing technical reports, articles, and presentations 
- Developer new mathematical models and software tools that applied machine learning, metamodeling, and image processing for manufacturing simulation that dramatically reduced analysis time and computational resources, are applicable to optimization and design exploration, and maintained minimal error 
(See ASME DETC 2011 publication for more information)  

__Dominion Power – Performance Excellence__, Richmond, VA May 2008 – August 2009

Engineering Intern

- Developed software applications using Excel VBA to analyze historical data, identify performance trends, and automatically offer predictions and recommendations for improving efficiency of primary power plant components, including centrifugal pumps, condensers, and turbines. These tools successfully identified critical problems, often weeks or months before they became apparent to plant personnel, and facilitated preventive and required maintenance in order to ensure peak performance
- Created a monthly performance reporting tool which programmatically collected data from a multitude of sources and performed analyses to determine itemized, as well as overall, plant performance and efficiency. This tool considerably expanding the amount and quality of performance data available to power plant management and engineers and was particularly useful for prioritizing process improvements and identifying maintenance issues
- Maintained and updated established analysis tools to utilize modern software, usability, and engineering techniques which significantly improved execution speed, reliability, and ease-of-use
