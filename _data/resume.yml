    blurb:
    details:
    - "Developed software applications using Visual Basic and Excel to analyze historical data, identify performance trends, and automatically offer predictions and recommendations for improving efficiency of primary power plant components, including centrifugal pumps, condensers, and turbines. These tools successfully identified critical problems, often weeks or months before they became apparent to plant personnel, and facilitated preventive and required maintenance in order to ensure peak performance"
    - "Created a monthly performance reporting tool which programmatically collected data from a multitude of sources and performed analyses to determine itemized, as well as overall, plant performance and efficiency. This tool considerably expanded the amount and quality of performance data available to power plant management and engineers and was particularly useful for prioritizing process improvements and identifying maintenance issues"

    blurb: |
      Compose complex, data-driven visualizations from reusable charts and components with d3. Was able to quickly create dynamic charts from common chart components for transferring scientific papers to the web.
    example: |
      ```js
      const chart = d3.select('#id').chart('Compose', data => {
        // Prepare data and scales
        const { input, output } = data;
        const xScale = { data: input, key: 'x' };
        const yScale = { data: input, key: 'y' };
        const y2Scale = { data: output, key: 'y' };

        // Set up charts (bars and lines) and components (x, y, and y2 axes)
        const charts = [
          d3c.bars('bars', { data: input, xScale, yScale });
          d3c.lines('lines', { data: output, xScale, yScale: y2Scale });
        ];

        const xAxis = d3c.axis('xAxis', { scale: xScale });
        const xAxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Year');
        const yAxis = d3c.axis('yAxis', { scale: yScale });
        const yAxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Input');
        const y2Axis = d3c.axis('y2Axis', { scale: y2Scale });
        const y2AxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Output');
        const title = d3c.title('Input vs. Output by Year');

        // Return layout of charts and components
        return [
          title,
          [yAxisTitle, yAxis, d3c.layered(charts), y2Axis, y2AxisTitle],
          xAxis,
          xAxisTitle
        ];
      });

      chart.draw({input: [/* ... */], output: [/* ... */]});

  - project: VBA-Web
    github:
      user: VBA-tools
      repo: VBA-Web
    blurb: |
      The most-starred VBA project on GitHub (admittedly a dubious honor) that gives structured web queries to Excel, Access, etc. for Windows and Mac (quite an accomplishment, since there was previously no straighforward way of accessing web services on Mac). Extracted from work coordinating Salesforce, Trello, and Ducksboard from Excel.
    example: |
      ```vb
      Dim Client As New WebClient
      Client.BaseUrl = "https://api.example.com/"

      Dim Request As New WebRequest
      Request.Resource = "users/123"
      Request.Method = WebMethod.HttpPut
      Request.Format = WebFormat.Json
      Request.AddBodyParameter "key", "value"

      Dim Response As WebResponse
      Set Response = Client.Execute(Request)
      ' -> PUT https://api.example.com/users/123 {"key":"value"}
      '    - JSON conversion and parsing
      '    - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
      '    - Authentication (Basic, OAuth, etc.)
      '    - and more!
      ```

      repo: VBA-TDD
    blurb: |
      I liked testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) so much, I ported it to Excel! Extracted from a system for verifying spreadsheets, VBA-TDD improved confidence in introducing new features and reduced critical errors in spreadsheets that were released across the country.
    example: |
      ```vb
      Dim Specs As New SpecSuite
      Specs.Description = "Test Workbook"

      ' Cleanup before each spec with "Cleanup" callback
      Specs.BeforeEach "Cleanup"

      With Specs.It("should add two numbers")
         .Expect(Add(2, 2)).ToEqual 4
      End With

      With Specs.It("should test complex things")
        .Expect(ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Hidden").Visible).ToNotEqual _
          XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetVisible
        .Expect(ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Main").Cells(1, 1).Interior.Color).ToEqual _
          RGB(255, 0, 0)
      End With
      ```
