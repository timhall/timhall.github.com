    blurb:
    details:
    - "Developed software applications using Visual Basic and Excel to analyze historical data, identify performance trends, and automatically offer predictions and recommendations for improving efficiency of primary power plant components, including centrifugal pumps, condensers, and turbines.

projects:
  - project: d3.compose
    github:
      user: CSNW
      repo: d3.compose
    blurb: |
      Compose complex, data-driven visualizations from reusable charts and components with d3. Was able to quickly create dynamic charts from common chart components for transferring scientific papers to the web.
    example: |
      ```js
      var chart = d3.select('#id').chart('Compose', function(data) {
        // Prepare data and scales
        var scales = {
          x: {data: data.input, key: 'x'},
          y: {data: data.input, key: 'y'},
          y2: {data: data.output, key: 'y'}
        };

        // Set up charts (bars and lines) and components (x, y, and y2 axes)
        var charts = [
          d3c.bars('bars', {data: data.input, xScale: scales.x, yScale: scales.y});
          d3c.lines('lines', {data: data.output, xScale: scales.x, yScale: scales.y2});
        ];

        var xAxis = d3c.axis('xAxis', {scale: scales.x});
        var xAxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Year');
        var yAxis = d3c.axis('yAxis', {scale: scales.y});
        var yAxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Input');
        var y2Axis = d3c.axis('y2Axis', {scale: scales.y2});
        var y2AxisTitle = d3c.axisTitle('Output');
        var title = d3c.title('Input vs. Output by Year');

        // Return layout of charts and components
        return [
          title,
          [yAxisTitle, yAxis, d3c.layered(charts), y2Axis, y2AxisTitle],
          xAxis,
          xAxisTitle
        ];
      });

      chart.draw({input: [/* ... */], output: [/* ... */]});

  - project: VBA-Web
    github:
      user: VBA-tools
      repo: VBA-Web
    blurb: |
      The most-starred VBA project on GitHub (admittedly a dubious honor) that gives structured web queries to Excel, Access, etc. for Windows and Mac (quite an accomplishment, since there was previously no straighforward way of accessing web services on Mac). Extracted from work coordinating Salesforce, Trello, and Ducksboard from Excel.
    example: |
      ```vb
      Dim Client As New WebClient
      Client.BaseUrl = "https://api.example.com/"

      Dim Request As New WebRequest
      Request.Resource = "users/123"
      Request.Method = WebMethod.HttpPut
      Request.Format = WebFormat.Json
      Request.AddBodyParameter "key", "value"

      Dim Response As WebResponse
      Set Response = Client.Execute(Request)
      ' -> PUT https://api.example.com/users/123 {"key":"value"}
      '    - JSON conversion and parsing
      '    - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
      '    - Authentication (Basic, OAuth, etc.)
      '    - and more!
      ```
  - project: knockout.collection
    github:
      user: timhall
      repo: knockout.collection
    blurb: |
      knockout.collection was designed to make it much simpler and more efficient to work with observable arrays in knockout.js. There are two primary issues with working with arrays in knockout.js: 1) Traditional approaches (e.g map or filter) causes the entire DOM that depends on the array to be re-rendered and 2) wiring up listeners for dependencies requires quite a bit of boilerplate and is error-prone. knockout.collection solved these problems and fixed a major pain point in developing a large knockout.js project.
    example: |
      ```js
      var messages = ko.observableArray([
        { id: 1, subject: 'Hi there!', from: 'Friend' },
        { id: 2, subject: 'Something important', from: 'Boss' },
        { id: 3, subject: 'Lunch?', from: 'Friend' },
        { id: 4, subject: 'Get back to work', from: 'Boss' }
      ]);
      var filterBy = ko.observable('Friend');

      var filteredMessages = ko.collection(messages).filter(function (message) {
        return message.from == filterBy();
      });
      // filteredMessages automatically recalculates whenever messages or filterBy changes

      // Features:
      // - filter, map, pluck, and uniq functions observe changes of internal observables
      // - results are patched, making redraws occur only as-needed
      // - results are cached to avoid unneccesary re-evaluations
      ```
  - project: VBA-TDD
    github:
      user: VBA-tools
      repo: VBA-TDD
    blurb: |
      I liked testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) so much, I ported it to Excel! Extracted from a system for verifying spreadsheets, VBA-TDD improved confidence in introducing new features and reduced critical errors in spreadsheets that were released across the country.
    example: |
      ```vb
      Dim Specs As New SpecSuite
      Specs.Description = "Test Workbook"

      ' Cleanup before each spec with "Cleanup" callback
      Specs.BeforeEach "Cleanup"

      With Specs.It("should add two numbers")
         .Expect(Add(2, 2)).ToEqual 4
      End With

      With Specs.It("should test complex things")
        .Expect(ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Hidden").Visible).ToNotEqual _
          XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetVisible
        .Expect(ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Main").Cells(1, 1).Interior.Color).ToEqual _
          RGB(255, 0, 0)
      End With
      ```
