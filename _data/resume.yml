    blurb: |
      The most-starred VBA project on GitHub (admittedly a dubious honor) that gives structured web queries to Excel, Access, etc. for Windows and Mac (quite an accomplishment, since there was previously no straighforward way of accessing web services on Mac). Extracted from work coordinating Salesforce and Trello from Excel.

    blurb: |
      I liked testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) so much, I ported it to Excel! Extracted from a system for verifying spreadsheets, vba-test improved confidence in introducing new features and reduced critical errors in spreadsheets that were released across the country.
