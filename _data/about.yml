    details:
    - "Work collaboratively as part of a remote team of developers on a large Backbone.js application, iteratively developing an advanced system that condenses extensive information and tasks into a focused, simple interface"
    - "Methodically update legacy code into maintainable components, including converting an existing native-to-client-side shim from Python to Node.js"
    - "Investigate and resolve bugs, often involving transient or low-level errors, introducing test cases to avoid future regressions and documenting or removing module couplings to reduce unforeseen interactions"
    - "Implement performance improvements such as utilizing caching or incremental updates for slow-running queries and applying asynchronous events to handle blocking or poorly-performing components"
    - "Create composable and configurable d3.chart system that dramatically simplifies the process of creating new chart types (Line, Bars, etc.) and allows rapid iteration of chart design and layout"
    - "Craft an asynchronous data layer for working with csv data in d3, including querying, caching, filtering, reducing, formatting, and other advanced behavior"

    blurb: 
    details:
    - "Developed software applications using Visual Basic and Excel to analyze historical data, identify performance trends, and automatically offer predictions and recommendations for improving efficiency of primary power plant components, including centrifugal pumps, condensers, and turbines. These tools successfully identified critical problems, often weeks or months before they became apparent to plant personnel, and facilitated preventive and required maintenance in order to ensure peak performance"
    - "Created a monthly performance reporting tool which programmatically collected data from a multitude of sources and performed analyses to determine itemized, as well as overall, plant performance and efficiency. This tool considerably expanded the amount and quality of performance data available to power plant management and engineers and was particularly useful for prioritizing process improvements and identifying maintenance issues"
    - "Maintained and updated established analysis tools to utilize modern software, usability, and engineering techniques which significantly improved execution speed, reliability, and ease-of-use"
